Baby smile:
S = {cry, smile, sleep}
A = {feed, don't feed}
R = {cry = -1, sleep = 1, smile = 2}

Parents want their baby to be smiling. We have 3 states S = {cry, smile, sleep}. Each individual state is asociated with a reward R = {cry = -1, sleep = 1, smile = 2}. 
To get the baby smiling we have 2 possible actions A = {feed, don't feed}. If we feed the baby it might still be crying (not enough food), which will give us a reward of -1. 
But it might also directly fall asleept, where we apply a reward of +1. We are also able to reach our target state, when we feed the baby and it is smiling. In that case we 
would assign a reward of +2. 
On the other hand, if we don't feed the baby it might continue crying, which gives a reward of -1, or it falls asleep, where we assign a reward of +1.   
 
Medical treatment:
S = {sick, well}
A = {no tratment, good treatment, bad treatment}
R = {sick = -1, well = 1}

If we think about a medical treatment of a person we consider 2 states, S = {sick, well}. The objective is to get a person into the state of well being. We consider 3 potential 
actions a doctor has, A = {no treatment, good treatment, bad treatment}. Each individual state is asociated with a reward R = {sick = -1, well = 1}. 
A patient might get well without any treatment, in that case we apply a reward of +1. But if he receives no treatment, the patient might still be in the state "sick". In that case 
we apply a reward of -1. Does a patient receive a bad treatment, then he will still be in the state "sick", which implies a reward of -1. If a patient receives a good treatmet, 
he gets well and therefore recives a reward of +1.

Roulette (red or black):
S = {win, lose}
A = {amount of money red, amount of money black}
R = {money won = +1, money lost = 1}

Our goal is to win money. We consider 2 states, S = {win, lose}. The gambler has a given amount of money (e.g. $100.-). He can only invest as much money as is available, which is our 
action, A = {amount of money}. Our rewards relate to the fact, if money is won or lost, R = {money won = +1, money lost = -1}. In general this might be a continuous task, but might 
be episodic if all money is lost. The gambler invests money (e.g. on red) and wins (ball on red), in that case he will receive a reward of + 1. In case of loosing (ball on black), 
his reward will be -1. Gambling ends, when the gambler looses more than he wins.
