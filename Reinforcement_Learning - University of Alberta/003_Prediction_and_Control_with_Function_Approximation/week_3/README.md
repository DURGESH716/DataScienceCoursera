**Module 1 - Episodic Sarsa with Function Approximation**  
**Module 2 - Exploration under Function Approximation**  
**Module 3 - Average Reward**  

- Explain the update for Episodic Sarsa with function approximation
- Introduce the feature choices, including passing actions to features or stacking state features
- Visualize value function and learning curves
- Discuss how this extends to Q-learning easily, since it is a subset of Expected Sarsa
- Understanding optimistically initializing your value function as a form of exploration
- Describe the average reward setting
- Explain when average reward optimal policies are different from discounted solutions
- Understand how differential value functions are different from discounted value functions
