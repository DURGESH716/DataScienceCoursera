**Module 03: Control with Approximation**  
**Lesson 1: Episodic Sarsa with Function Approximation**
- Explain the update for Episodic Sarsa with function approximation
- Introduce the feature choices, including passing actions to features or stacking state features
- Visualize value function and learning curves
- Discuss how this extends to Q-learning easily, since its a subset of Expected Sarsa

**Lesson 2: Exploration under Function Approximation**   
- Understanding optimistically initializing your value function as a form of exploration

**Lesson 3: Average Reward**  
- Describe the average reward setting
- Explain when average reward optimal policies are different from discounted solutions
- Understand how differential value functions are different from discounted value functions
