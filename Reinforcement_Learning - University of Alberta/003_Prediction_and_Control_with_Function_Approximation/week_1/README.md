**Module 01: On-policy prediction with approximation**  

**Lesson 1: Estimating Value Functions as Supervised Learning**  
- Understand how we can use parameterized functions to approximate value functions
- Explain the meaning of linear value function approximation
- Recognize that the tabular case is a special case of linear value function approximation.
- Understand that there are many ways to parameterize an approximate value function
- Understand what is meant by generalization and discrimination
- Understand how generalization can be beneficial
- Explain why we want both generalization and discrimination from our function approximation
- Understand how value estimation can be framed as a supervised learning problem
- Recognize not all function approximation methods are well suited for reinforcement learning
